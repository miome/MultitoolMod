# Multitool
## What is it?
Multitool is a Stardew SMAPI mod, created as an alternative to AlmightyTool. Point at the tile you want to act on and press a button, and Multitool choses the right tool and uses it.

## How to install it
Install the latest version of SMAPI from [https://smapi.io].
   * Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
   * Run the game using SMAPI.

## Using Multitool
   * Hover your mouse cursor over the object or location you want to use the tool on. Press 'Q' and Multitool will chose a tool and use it.  If Multitool can't figure out which tool to use, it will take no action.
   * Press 'I' over a location to see the information Multitool has about a location
   * Some mods can result in a buggy Null 'item' in your inventory that shuts your inventory screen as soon as you open it. If you are seeing this behavior, press 'C' and Multitool will remove Null items from your inventory.

## Compatibility
Works with Stardew Valley 1.4 and SMAPI 3.2
